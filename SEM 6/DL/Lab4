Aim-Create a neural network from scratch for a multiclass classification
task with the following architecture:

Input layer: 4 neurons
First hidden layer: 3 neurons
Second hidden layer: 4 neurons
Output layer: 3 neurons



Generate a random dataset for a 3-class classification problem. Apply
the designed neural network on generated dataset using the ReLU activation
function in the hidden layers and the softmax activation function in the output
layer for multiclass classification. Use categorical cross-entropy as the loss
function for training. Additionally, implement the Gradient Descent, Momentum
based GD, NAG, AdaGrad, RMS prop, Adam optimizer as part of the training
process. Train the neural network using all optimizers and evaluate their
performance on the dataset using performance metrics accuracy.
